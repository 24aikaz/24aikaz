Heyo! You can call me Zaki. 
I'm a Computer Science student and currently my interests in CS are quite diverse.
I'm currently learning C++ and a few more languages(Prolog, Racket, the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and JS).
No active projects yet.

Find me under the same username on Reddit and 24aikaz#6756 on Discord
