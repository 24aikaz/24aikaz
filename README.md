Hey there! I'm Zakiyyah, a 21-year-old explorer in the vast realm of code and creativity. You can call me Zaki for short, and I'm currently rocking my final year in B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science. 
<br><br>
My passion for technology knows no bounds, but lately, I've been diving deep into the exciting realms of web3.0, networking (including the fascinating worlds of cloud technologies and IoT). 
<br><br>
Feel free to connect with me through my social links â€“ I'm on LinkedIn for all things professional. For more casual tech chats, you'll find me on Discord under the same username as my GitHub handle.

Let's build something awesome together and shape the future of tech!
